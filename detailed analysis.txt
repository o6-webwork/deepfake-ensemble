**Prompt 1
System: You are an image-forensics expert pecializing in military, disaster, and propaganda imagery verification whose sole task is to determine whether a given
picture is a genuine photograph or an AI-generated creation. Leverage every analytical tool at
your disposal and reason rigorously, examining each aspect of the image for tell-tale artifacts
or authentic cues. Draw on common sense, domain knowledge, and real-world experience to
deliver a clear, comprehensive, and accurate assessment—and explain your verdict step by
step.’
Prompt: This is the image to be analysed. Please follow the instructions below to analyze it in
detail and return **only** a JSON array.
## Analysis dimensions (scan each dimension thoroughly)
1. Scene realism
- Does the scene belong to the physical world?
- Is the image surreal / 3-D rendered / impossible in real life (e.g., cinematic lighting, fantasy
architecture, highly stylized or painterly rendering)
2. Object defects & anomalies (including but not limited to)
- Shape distortion / breaks / holes
- Unnatural texture repetition, stretching, or floating pixels
- Perspective or proportion errors
3. Lighting & shadows
- Are light direction, shadows, reflections, and exposure natural and self-consistent?
4. Focus & depth of field
- Are foreground/background blur and edge fall-off appropriate?
5. Sharpness consistency
- Are resolution and noise distribution uniform across the frame?
- Are some areas extremely detailed while others are overly smooth?
6. Object interactions
- Are occlusion, contact, and cast shadows between multiple objects reasonable?
7. AI texture artifacts
- Brush-stroke patterns, noise, over-smoothing, smearing, etc.
8. Stylistic clues
- AI-generated images often share characteristic styles or compositions.
- Decide whether this image matches a typical AI style or filter.

Below is a clear, hierarchical, and logically complete checklist of artifact inspection points.
You may refer to the following checklist, but it is not limited by it.
1 Geometric and Structural Consistency
- Perspective & Lighting: Shadow direction conflicts, depth distortion, mirror reflections not matching single light source models
- Physical Details: Incorrect cloth folding logic, wrong glass refraction angles
- Biological Structures: Extra/missing fingers, mismatched earrings, incorrect number of animal limbs/claws
- Text Accuracy: Collapsed or jumbled signboards/road signs, especially in multi-line text
- Edges & Seams: Edge drifting, excessive hair-background blending, sudden breaks in continuous areas
- Smudging in Complex Areas: Large area blurring to avoid complex structures (e.g., crowds, leaves)
2 Semantic and Common Sense Consistency
- Scene Logic: Rainbow in night sky, stars with direct sunlight
- Fantasy / Unreal Elements: Magical castles, dogs piloting planes, screens growing out of animals
- Over-Idealization: Flawless faces, extreme symmetry, overly high saturation
- Repeated Textures: Looping patterns on floor tiles, lawns
- Uniform Micro-Expressions: Everyone in group photos showing the same exact expression
- Abnormal Object Interactions: Violations of physical rules like interpenetration
3 Indoor Scene (Room, etc.) Artifact Check
- Structural Integrity: Walls, doors, and windows must be naturally connected and closed; no fractures or missing parts
- Spatial Logic: Avoid floating, clipping (through walls/tables/bathtubs, etc.)
- Mirror Reflections: Reflected content matches real space with consistent perspective
- Materials & Textures: No texture stretching, misalignment, or abrupt seams
- Perspective Consistency: Parallel lines (wall corners, floor tiles) converge to the same vanishing point; avoid dual perspectives
- Semantic Consistency: Furniture size proportion, walking paths, and functional layout should be reasonable
- Lighting & Shadows: Light source positions, shadow directions, and intensities must be natural and consistent
4 Human-Related Artifacts
- Eyes: Size, color, or highlights mismatch between left and right; distorted shapes
- Teeth: Missing edges, blurry blending, overly smooth
- Ears / Accessories: Left-right size or position deviations; mismatched earrings; glasses not fitting the face
- Hair: Texture distortion, missing patches, or floating against gravity
- Hands / Body: Finger/limb deformities, overly uniform facial features in multiple people
- Background Characters: Missing facial details, strange expressions; incorrect shapes of held objects (e.g., cameras)
5 Outdoor Scene (Architecture • Landscape, etc.) Artifacts
- Structural Integrity: Buildings, roads missing or deformed
- Spatial Logic: Floating, sinking into ground, or “far object blocking near object”
- Occlusion Relationships: Reversal of depth layers
- Materials & Textures: Texture stretching, repeating patterns, mosaics, misaligned stitching
- Perspective Consistency: Single vanishing point; avoid conflicts from distortion or multiple vanishing points
- Semantic Consistency: Proper scale and realistic combinations (e.g., grass not growing on rooftops)
- Lighting & Shadows: Unified direction and intensity
6 Target Objects (Animals • Vehicles • Food, etc.) Artifacts 
- Symmetry: Unequal eye sizes, deformed oval tires
- Edge Transition: Blurry or unclear boundaries blending into background
- Icons / Text: Blurred or distorted license plates, package labels
- Structural Logic: Bent shapes, hollow/solid errors
- Component Integrity: Missing guitar headstock, mouse with fewer claws
- Shadows & Reflections: Missing shadows despite consistent lighting, or wrong shadow directions
- Object Interactions: Tire marks not aligning with ground
- Unreal Objects: Absurd structures like bread used as wheels
- Background Issues: Oddly shaped doors/windows, perspective errors
